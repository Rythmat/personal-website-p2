        <h3>I love yoga!</h3>
        <p>
          There is nothing wrong with seeing or with sight, there is nothing wrong with things seen, and in the same way, there is absolutely nothing wrong with anything that happens to you - neither what is called pleasure nor what is called pain - as long as you do not call it anything and can just be that, without creating a division.
        </p>
        <p>
          You go on seeing and, in the intensity of that vision, suddenly there is an understanding that seeing alone is true, observation alone is true, pure experiencing alone is true. What is considered the ego is nothing but the pure experiencing, wanting as it were to experience its own experience. There is suddenly the awareness that consciousness is all the time, and all experiencing is made possible in that consciousness by that consciousness. Consciousness rests, without a division, as the totality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The see-er, or sight, remains as the pure experiencing, just as the ocean constantly remains the ocean. The waves may be breaking on the shore, but the ocean is not diminished thereby; the waves may be rolling back into the sea, but the ocean is not increased. In that pure experiencing, there is no sorrow. Because this is unusual, the mind suggests that it is probably not true. But if you examine the state of sleep, you see that there is no sorrow there, because there is not a division of the experience of sleep and the experiencer of sleep. You do not sleep; sleep sleeps you, or sleep sleeps itself and you are merely involved in it.
        </p>
        <p class = "lastp">
          Any experience of a similar nature, in which there is no divided experience, is pure. In it there is no sin and no suffering. Such is the state of a yogi.

        <h3>I love music!</h3>
        <p>
          Music is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content. Music is generally agreed to be a cultural universal that is present in all human societies. Definitions of music vary widely in substance and approach. While scholars agree that music is defined by a small number of specific elements, there is no consensus as to what these necessary elements are. Music is often characterized as a highly versatile medium for expressing human creativity.

          Music therapy has shown promise in providing a safe and supportive environment for healing trauma and building resilience while decreasing anxiety levels and improving the functioning of depressed individuals. Music therapy is an evidence-based therapeutic intervention using music to accomplish health and education goals, such as improving mental wellness, reducing stress and alleviating pain. Music therapy is offered in settings such as schools and hospitals. Research supports that engaging in music-making activities, such as drumming circles, songwriting, or group singing, can facilitate emotional release, promote self-reflection, and create a sense of community.

          Dance is an art form, consisting of sequences of body movements with aesthetic and often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully selected. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements or by its historical period or place of origin. Dance is typically performed with musical accompaniment, and sometimes with the dancer simultaneously using a musical instrument themselves.

        <h3>I love food!</h3>
        <p>
          Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nutrition is the biochemical and physiological process by which an organism uses food to support its life. It provides organisms with nutrients, which can be metabolized to create energy and chemical structures. Failure to obtain the required amount of nutrients causes malnutrition. Nutritional science is the study of nutrition, though it typically emphasizes human nutrition.
        </p>
        <p class = "lastp">
          In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism. The word diet often implies the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos. This may be due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthy.
