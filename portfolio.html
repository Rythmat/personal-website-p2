      <h3><span>Building a desktop</span></h3>
      <p> I purchased parts and built a desktop from scratch with minimal guidance. Up until the point of downloading software and booting from BIOS, I worked mostly on my own. This desktop became my personal computer for the following several years.</p>

      <h3><span>Coding a image generator</span></h3>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2024, I wanted to finish an art project I'd been scheming. After thinking of all it's possible iterations, I decided it would be more efficient to code the creation process. To fill a 8x8 grid of squares with 4 different colors in four mirrored quadrants makes 13,824 entries. I only did this math after finishing a python program that prints raw RGB data into a ppm file. I didn't want to wait for my computer to process all these iterations, so I cut my losses and came out with the simple image generator. Here's a cool image that was made after messing around with the RGB parameters.
